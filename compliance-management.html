            <h2>Introduction to Compliance Management</h2>
            <p>
                Compliance Management in the context of DevSecOps refers to the practices and tools that ensure software development and deployment adhere to regulatory and organizational standards. As software becomes more integral to business operations, ensuring that it meets compliance standards is crucial to avoid legal repercussions and maintain trust with stakeholders.

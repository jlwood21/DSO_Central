        <h2>Introduction to Security Automation</h2>
        <p>
          Security Automation is the process of integrating security practices
          into the DevOps pipeline. It involves automating repetitive and
          time-consuming tasks, allowing security teams to focus on more complex
          issues. With the increasing complexity of cyber threats, security
          automation tools are becoming essential for rapid threat detection and
          mitigation.
        </p>

        <h2>Top Security Automation Tools</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>

        <h2>Benefits of Security Automation</h2>
        <p>
          Integrating security automation tools within the DevSecOps pipeline
          offers numerous advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rapid threat detection: Automated tools can scan vast codebases in
            minutes, identifying vulnerabilities faster than manual processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consistency: Automation ensures that security checks are
            consistently applied across all projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Efficiency: By automating repetitive tasks, security teams can focus
            on more complex and critical issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuous monitoring: Ensure that as new threats emerge, they are

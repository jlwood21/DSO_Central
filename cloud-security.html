        <h2>Introduction to Cloud Security</h2>
        <p>
          Cloud security, often referred to as cloud computing security,
          encompasses a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls
          deployed to protect data, applications, and the associated
          infrastructure of cloud computing. As organizations increasingly shift
          to cloud environments, ensuring the security of these environments
          becomes paramount.

        <h2>Benefits of Cloud Security</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing robust cloud security measures offers several advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Protection from Threats: Cloud security tools offer real-time
            monitoring and threat detection, ensuring that cloud resources are
            protected from potential attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Protection: Ensures that sensitive data stored in the cloud is
            encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compliance: Many industries have strict regulatory requirements
            regarding data protection. Cloud security tools ensure that cloud
            environments adhere to these regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Visibility and Control: Provides organizations with a clear view of
            their cloud resources and the ability to control access and
            configurations.

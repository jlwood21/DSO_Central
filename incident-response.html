        <h2>Introduction to Incident Response</h2>
        <p>
          Incident response is the process of identifying, investigating, and
          addressing security incidents in an organized and efficient manner. In
          the context of DevSecOps, it's about ensuring that when security
          incidents occur, they are handled swiftly, minimizing potential damage
          and preventing future occurrences.
        </p>

        <h2>Importance of Incident Response in DevSecOps</h2>
        <p>
          With the integration of security into the DevOps process, it's crucial
          to have a robust incident response plan in place. This ensures that
          security incidents are not only detected promptly but also addressed
          in a way that aligns with the organization's security and operational
          goals.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Preparation:</strong> Develop a comprehensive incident
            response plan that outlines roles, responsibilities, and procedures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Detection & Analysis:</strong> Use advanced monitoring and
            detection tools to identify potential security incidents in
            real-time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Containment:</strong> Once an incident is detected, take
            immediate steps to contain the impact and prevent further damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eradication & Recovery:</strong> Identify the root cause of
            the incident, eradicate it, and restore systems to their normal
            operational state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> After handling an incident,
            conduct a thorough review to identify lessons learned and improve
            future response efforts.

            <h2>Introduction to Security Analytics</h2>
            <p>
                Security Analytics involves the collection, aggregation, and analysis of data to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats. In the context of DevSecOps, security analytics tools provide real-time threat detection, user behavior analytics, and deep forensic capabilities, offering actionable insights for threat mitigation.

            <h2>Importance of Security Analytics in DevSecOps</h2>
            <p>
                As cyber threats become more sophisticated, traditional security measures may not suffice. Security analytics tools provide a deeper understanding of threats by analyzing patterns, behaviors, and anomalies. This proactive approach helps in early detection and response, reducing the potential impact of security breaches.

      <h1>Threat Modeling: An Overview</h1>
      <section id="introduction">
        <p>
          Threat modeling is a systematic approach used to identify, quantify,
          and address the security risks associated with an application. It's a
          proactive measure that allows teams to understand the potential
          threats and vulnerabilities in the system and design countermeasures
          to mitigate them.

        <h2>1. Identifying Threats</h2>
        <h3>A. Asset Identification</h3>
        <p>
          The first step is to identify the assets that need protection. Assets
          can be data, systems, or any valuable component.
        </p>
        <h3>B. Threat Agents</h3>
        <p>
          Identify who might want to attack the system. Threat agents can be
          internal or external entities.
        </p>
        <h3>C. Threat Vectors</h3>
        <p>
          These are the paths or means by which a threat agent can reach an
          asset.
        </p>

      <section id="threat-quantification">
        <h2>2. Threat Quantification</h2>
        <h3>A. Risk Assessment</h3>
        <p>
          The risk associated with each threat can be quantified using
          mathematical expressions:
        </p>
        <pre>R=PÃ—I</pre>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>R: Risk</li>
          <li>P: Probability of the threat occurring</li>
          <li>I: Impact of the threat</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>B. STRIDE Methodology</h3>
        <p>STRIDE is a popular model used to categorize threats:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>S: Spoofing</li>
          <li>T: Tampering</li>
          <li>R: Repudiation</li>
          <li>I: Information Disclosure</li>
          <li>D: Denial of Service</li>
          <li>E: Elevation of Privilege</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="designing-countermeasures">
        <h2>3. Designing Countermeasures</h2>
        <h3>A. Security Controls</h3>
        <p>
          Implementing security controls to mitigate identified threats. These
          can be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Preventive Controls</li>
          <li>Detective Controls</li>
          <li>Corrective Controls</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>B. Security Policies</h3>
        <p>
          Developing and enforcing security policies that align with the
          identified threats.
        </p>

      <section id="examples-and-use-cases">
        <h2>4. Examples and Use Cases</h2>
        <h3>A. E-Commerce Platform</h3>
        <p>
          For an e-commerce platform, threat modeling might identify threats
          like SQL injection, CSRF attacks, etc. Countermeasures might include
          input validation, using prepared statements, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>B. Banking Application</h3>
        <p>
          In a banking application, threats like unauthorized access, data
          leakage might be identified. Countermeasures might include
          multi-factor authentication, encryption, etc.
        </p>

      <section id="continuous-monitoring">
        <h2>5. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement</h2>
        <p>
          Threat modeling is not a one-time activity. Continuous monitoring and
          updating the threat model are essential to adapt to the evolving
          threat landscape.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Threat modeling is a vital practice in DevSecOps that enables teams to
          be proactive rather than reactive in their security efforts. By
          understanding the threat landscape, identifying potential threats,
          quantifying them, and designing appropriate countermeasures,
          organizations can build more secure applications.

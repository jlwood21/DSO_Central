        <h2>Introduction to Vulnerability Scanning</h2>
        <p>
          Vulnerability scanning is a critical component of any robust security
          strategy. It involves automated processes that proactively identify
          security vulnerabilities in an application, allowing developers to
          address them before they can be exploited. With the rise of cyber
          threats, having a reliable vulnerability scanning tool is paramount.
        </p>

        <h2>Top Vulnerability Scanning Tools</h2>

        <h2>Benefits of Vulnerability Scanning</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing vulnerability scanning within the DevSecOps pipeline
          offers numerous benefits:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Proactive threat detection: Identify vulnerabilities before they can
            be exploited.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved code quality: By identifying vulnerabilities at the code
            level, developers can write more secure code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compliance: Many regulatory frameworks require regular vulnerability
            assessments. Automated scanning ensures compliance with these
            regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuous monitoring: Ensure that as new vulnerabilities emerge,
            they are detected and addressed promptly.
          </li>
        </ul>

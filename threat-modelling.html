            <h2>Introduction to Threat Modeling</h2>
            <p>
                Threat modeling is a structured approach used to identify, prioritize, and mitigate potential threats in a system or application. It involves visualizing the system's architecture, identifying potential threats, assessing their impact, and devising strategies to mitigate or eliminate those threats.
            </p>

            <h2>Importance of Threat Modeling in DevSecOps</h2>
            <p>
                In the DevSecOps paradigm, security is integrated throughout the software development lifecycle. Threat modeling plays a crucial role in this by ensuring that security considerations are addressed during the design phase, reducing vulnerabilities in the final product.
            </p>

            <h2>Top Threat Modeling Tools</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microsoft's Threat Modeling Tool:</strong> A free tool from Microsoft that helps in identifying and mitigating potential security threats in a systematic manner.</li>
                <li><strong>OWASP Threat Dragon:</strong> An open-source threat modeling web application from OWASP, providing a rich set of features for threat modeling.</li>
                <li><strong>IriusRisk:</strong> A comprehensive threat modeling platform that integrates with other DevSecOps tools, offering a holistic approach to threat management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Best Practices for Threat Modeling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Integration:</strong> Integrate threat modeling early in the design phase to identify and address threats proactively.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Reviews:</strong> Periodically review and update threat models to account for changes in the system and evolving threat landscapes.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Approach:</strong> Involve stakeholders from various disciplines, including developers, security experts, and business teams, in the threat modeling process.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Stay updated with the latest threat intelligence and incorporate those insights into your threat models.</li>
            </ul>

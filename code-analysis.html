<h2>Introduction to Code Analysis</h2>
<p>
          Code analysis, often referred to as static code analysis, is a method
          of inspecting the source code of an application without executing it.
          It's a crucial step in the DevSecOps process, ensuring that the code
          is not only functional but also secure from potential vulnerabilities.
        </p>
<h2>Importance of Code Analysis in DevSecOps</h2>
<p>
          In the realm of DevSecOps, security is integrated throughout the
          software development lifecycle. Code analysis plays a pivotal role in
          this integration, identifying vulnerabilities at the code level,
          ensuring that they are addressed before the application goes into
          production.
        </p>
<h2>Top Code Analysis Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>SonarQube:</strong> An open-source platform used by
            developers to manage source code quality. It provides detailed
            reports on code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Checkmarx:</strong> A software security solution that
            identifies, tracks, and fixes technical and logical security flaws
            in the source code.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Codacy:</strong> An automated code review tool that helps
            developers to improve code quality, security, and maintainability.
          </li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices for Code Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Regular Scans:</strong> Conduct code analysis at regular
            intervals, preferably after every major code commit.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Integrate with CI/CD:</strong> Integrate code analysis tools
            with your CI/CD pipeline to ensure real-time feedback on code
            quality and security.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Address Issues Promptly:</strong> Prioritize and address
            identified vulnerabilities and issues promptly to reduce potential
            risks.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>Collaborative Reviews:</strong> Encourage peer reviews and
            collaborative code analysis sessions to gain diverse insights and
            catch potential oversights.

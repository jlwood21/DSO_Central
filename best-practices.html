      <h1>DevSecOps Best Practices</h1>
      <p>
        Embracing DevSecOps means integrating security into every step of the
        development process. Here are some of the most effective best practices
        to ensure a secure and efficient DevSecOps workflow.

        <h2>
          <a href="best-practice-1.html">1. Early Integration of Security</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Security should not be an afterthought. By integrating security
          measures right from the design and planning phase, teams can identify
          potential vulnerabilities early, reducing the risk and cost associated
          with late-stage security issues.

        <h2>
          <a href="best-practice-2.html">2. Continuous Security Testing</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Automated security testing should be a core component of the CI/CD
          pipeline. By continuously testing applications for vulnerabilities,
          teams can ensure that security issues are detected and addressed
          promptly, keeping the software secure at all times.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="best-practice-3.html">3. Collaborative Culture</a></h2>
        <p>
          DevSecOps thrives on collaboration. Development, operations, and
          security teams should work closely, sharing knowledge and insights.
          This collaborative approach ensures that security considerations are
          communicated effectively and that all team members are aligned in
          their goals.

        <h2>
          <a href="best-practice-4.html">4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          By treating infrastructure as code, teams can apply the same
          versioning, testing, and automation practices they use for software
          development. This ensures that the entire application environment is
          consistent, reproducible, and secure.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="best-practice-5.html">5. Regular Security Training</a></h2>
        <p>
          Keeping the team updated with the latest security threats and
          mitigation techniques is crucial. Regular training sessions can equip
          team members with the knowledge they need to develop secure
          applications and respond effectively to security incidents.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2><a href="best-practice-6.html">6. Threat Modeling</a></h2>
        <p>
          Understanding potential threats is key to building secure
          applications. Threat modeling involves identifying potential security
          threats and designing countermeasures to mitigate them. By
          understanding the threat landscape, teams can be more proactive in
          their security efforts.

        <h2><a href="best-practice-7.html">7. Use of Security Tools</a></h2>
        <p>
          There are numerous tools available that can automate various aspects
          of the security process, from vulnerability scanning to configuration
          management. Integrating these tools into the DevSecOps workflow can
          enhance security and efficiency.
